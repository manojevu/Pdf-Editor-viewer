Local PDF Editor

A lightweight, in-browser PDF editor that runs completely on the client-side. No server uploads, no data tracking, total privacy.

üìñ About The Project

This project is a powerful, single-file HTML application that allows users to perform common PDF editing tasks directly in their web browser. The key value proposition is privacy and speed. Since all processing is handled by the user's browser using JavaScript, sensitive documents are never uploaded to an external server.

This makes it an ideal tool for anyone who needs to quickly edit a PDF without compromising the security of their data.
